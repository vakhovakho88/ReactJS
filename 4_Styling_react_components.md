## **Git Personal Reference - Styling in React**

### **Introduction**
- React apps involve more than just component composition and logic.
- Styling ensures that React applications are visually appealing.
  
### **Styling Techniques**
1. **Dynamic or Conditional Styling:**
   - Set styles based on certain conditions.
   - *Example:* Coloring an input field red if user input is invalid.

2. **Scoped Styling:**
   - Styles that are limited to a specific component without global application.
   - Ensures one component's styles don't unintentionally affect others.

3. **Styled Components (Third-Party Library):**
   - Allows the creation of pre-styled components with scoped styles.
   - Very popular in the React community.

4. **CSS Modules:**
   - Another approach to ensure styles are scoped to specific components.

### **Demo Project Overview**
- **Functionality:** 
  - Allows adding course goals (e.g., "learn React").
  - Added goals appear in a list.
  - Clicking on a list item deletes it.
  
- **Features Used:** 
  - `useState` for state management.
  - Functions bound to events.
  - Dynamically outputting lists using `map`.

### **Getting Started with the Demo Project:**
1. Download the attached project.
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory to install necessary packages.
3. Start the project with `npm start`.
4. Familiarize yourself with the source code and structure.

### **Objective of the Section:**
- Explore various styling options available in React.

### **Key Takeaway:**
- Styling is a vital aspect of React development, offering various techniques to effectively and attractively present your components.

## **Git Personal Reference - Dynamic Styling in React**

### **1. Project Set-Up**
Ensure your project is set up correctly, referring back to previous lectures for guidance.

**Example:** 
```css
.goal-list {
  /*...some styles...*/
}
```
The above CSS class `.goal-list` affects any element with that specific class.

### **2. Objective of Dynamic Styling**
Alter styles based on user actions or input.

**Example:** Highlight the input area in red if a user submits an empty goal.

### **3. Detecting Valid Input**
Check if the user input is considered valid.

**Example:**
```javascript
if (enteredValue.trim().length === 0) {
  // Input is empty
}
```

### **4. Tracking Input Validity with State**
Leverage `useState` to maintain a record of input validity.

**Example:**
```javascript
const [isValid, setIsValid] = useState(true);
if (!isValid) {
  // Apply invalid styling
}
```

### **5. Applying Conditional Styles**
Dynamically apply styles based on conditions using React's `style` prop.

**Example:**
```javascript
<label style={{ color: !isValid ? 'red' : 'black' }}>
  /* ... */
</label>
```
The label color switches between red (for invalid) and black (for valid).

### **6. Resetting Styles**
Reset styles once user input becomes valid.

**Example:**
```javascript
if (inputValue.trim().length > 0) {
  setIsValid(true);
}
```
When a user starts typing in a previously invalid input, the error styles are removed.

### **7. Concerns with Inline Styles**
- **Duplication:** Having both CSS and inline styles.
- **Priority:** Inline styles will override other CSS styles, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

### **Conclusion**
While inline styles offer a fast way to implement dynamic styling in React components, their high priority and potential for code duplication might lead to complications in complex projects. Consider alternative methods for achieving the same results.

## **Git Personal Reference - Dynamic Class Handling in React**

### **1. Alternative to Inline Styles**
Instead of inline styles, utilize dynamic CSS classes based on conditions.

### **2. Dynamically Adding a CSS Class**
Add a new CSS class to an element based on specific conditions, like invalid input.

**Example:** 
```javascript
const classNameString = `form-control ${!isValid ? 'invalid' : ''}`;
```
The `form-control` class always exists. The `invalid` class is only appended if the input is invalid.

### **3. Utilizing Template Literals**
Use JavaScript's template literals to dynamically create a string with the desired classes.

**Example:**
```javascript
<div className={`form-control ${!isValid ? 'invalid' : ''}`}>
  /* ... */
</div>
```
The class name will either be "form-control" or "form-control invalid" based on the `isValid` state.

### **4. Styling Using Dynamic Classes**
In your CSS file, create styles for your dynamic classes. 

**Example:**
```css
.form-control.invalid label {
  color: red;
}

.form-control.invalid input {
  border-color: red;
  background: lightcoral;
}
```

### **5. React's Role**
React ensures that the Document Object Model (DOM) is updated based on the dynamic classes you've set. It adds or removes classes in the DOM as necessary.

### **Conclusion**
By using dynamic CSS class assignments, you can achieve dynamic styling without relying on inline styles. This approach keeps style definitions within CSS files and allows React to handle the dynamic application of these styles.



Certainly! Let's distill the content into its core concepts and provide an example.

### **Git Personal Reference: Styled-Components in React**

#### **1. Introduction**
Styled-Components allow dynamic setting of styles and classes in React. Unlike regular CSS files, these styles are scoped specifically to the component they're applied to.

#### **2. Basic Concept**
- Regular CSS files impact all elements matching selectors globally.
- With Styled-Components, styles are scoped to the component.

  ```javascript
  import styled from 'styled-components';
  ```

#### **3. Using Styled-Components**
- Install the package:
  ```
  npm install --save styled-components
  ```
- https://styled-components.com/
- 
- **Basic Usage**:

  ```javascript
  const StyledButton = styled.button`
      background: white;
      &:hover {
          background: gray;
      }
  `;
  ```

  Here, `StyledButton` is a React component with the specified styles. The `&` is a placeholder for the component's name, useful for pseudo-selectors.

#### **4. Dynamic Styling with Props**

  ```javascript
  const ColoredButton = styled.button`
      background: ${props => props.bgColor || 'white'};
  `;

  // Usage:
  <ColoredButton bgColor="blue">Blue Button</ColoredButton>
  ```

  In the above example, the background color of the button changes based on the passed `bgColor` prop.

#### **5. Scoped Styles**
- Styled-Components generate unique class names for every styled component. This ensures no style spill-overs between components.
- Examining the element in developer tools will show a uniquely generated class name, which is handled behind the scenes.

#### **6. Dynamic and Conditional Styling**
With Styled-Components, you can easily integrate dynamic and conditional styles based on component state, props, or any JavaScript logic.







## **Git Reference: Styled Components in React**

### **1. Introduction**
Styled components allow for styling React components using a unique and more dynamic approach than regular CSS.

### **2. Benefits**
- Encapsulation: Each styled component has unique class names, so styles don't spill over.
- Dynamic Styling: Styled components can adjust styles based on their props.

### **3. How to Use**

**a. Basic Usage:**
```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const MyStyledDiv = styled.div`
  background: lightgray;
`;
```
In the above example, we've created a styled `div` with a `lightgray` background.

**b. Multiple Components in One File:**
While it's good practice to have one component per file, styled components can be co-located if they're closely related.
  
**c. Nested Selectors:**
```javascript
const MyStyledDiv = styled.div`
  label {
    color: blue;
  }
`;
```
Here, a nested `label` within `MyStyledDiv` will have a color of blue.

**d. Dynamic Styling Based on Props:**
```javascript
const DynamicDiv = styled.div`
  background: ${props => props.invalid ? 'red' : 'transparent'};
`;
```
Here, `DynamicDiv` adjusts its background based on the `invalid` prop passed to it.

### **4. Note**
Styled components can replace the traditional approach of using class names for dynamic styling. However, it may require a shift in mindset.






## **Git Reference: Media Queries with Styled Components**

### **1. Introduction**
Media queries are essential for responsive design, ensuring that your web application looks good on various device sizes. Styled Components, a popular library in React, can efficiently handle media queries.

### **2. Using Media Queries with Styled Components**

When integrating media queries in Styled Components, the approach is straightforward:

- Define the styles directly inside the media query.
- No need for selectors or nesting unless targeting nested elements or pseudo-selectors.

### **3. Examples**

**a. Default Button Styling for Mobile:**

If you want a button to span the entire width on mobile devices, but only take up the space it needs on larger screens, here's how you'd set it up:

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  width: 100%;  // Default width for mobile
  
  @media (min-width: 768px) {  // Media query for larger screens
    width: auto;
  }
`;
```

Usage:

```jsx
<Button>Click Me!</Button>
```

On mobile, this button will span the full width. On larger screens, it will adjust its width based on content.

### **4. Key Takeaways**

- Styled Components make it simple to implement media queries directly, providing a clean way to handle responsive designs.
- You can add your media query criteria directly (`@media (min-width: 768px)`) and then specify styles for when that condition is met.
- It ensures encapsulated styles, so components don't affect others unintentionally.

---

Remember to always test your application on various devices or use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes for best results!


## **Git Reference: Using CSS Modules in React**

### **1. Introduction**
CSS Modules is a styling approach that allows you to encapsulate styles at the component level, ensuring no global side effects. It achieves this by generating unique class names for each component.

### **2. Benefits**
- **Separation**: Maintain a clear distinction between JS and CSS.
- **Scoped Styles**: No risk of styles spilling over to other components.
- **Familiarity**: Leverage plain CSS without the need to mix it with JS.

### **3. How to Use**

**a. File Naming:**
CSS Modules requires you to name your CSS files with the `.module.css` extension.

For instance: `Button.module.css`.

**b. Importing Styles:**

You import styles as an object from the CSS module file.

```javascript
import styles from './Button.module.css';
```

**c. Applying Styles:**

Utilize the imported styles object in your JSX. Each class in your CSS becomes a property on this object.

```javascript
<button className={styles.button}>Click Me!</button>
```

### **4. Examples**

**Button.module.css:**
```css
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

**Button.js:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import styles from './Button.module.css';

function Button() {
  return (
    <button className={styles.button}>Click Me!</button>
  );
}
```

When rendered, the browser will display a button with a unique class name (e.g., `Button_button_1a2b3c`), which includes styles defined in `Button.module.css`.

### **5. Key Takeaways**
- CSS Modules allows you to combine the best of both worlds: traditional CSS and component-scoped styles.
- Styles are encapsulated and don't bleed out, ensuring consistent and predictable styling.
- It requires specific configuration (but projects created with `create-react-app` have it out of the box).

---

Remember: the unique class names generated by CSS Modules ensure that there's no clash in styles, making component styling more predictable and maintainable.



## **Git Reference: Using CSS Modules in React Components**

### **1. Introduction**
CSS Modules provides a way to scope CSS locally to components, ensuring no class name clashes and keeping CSS separate from JavaScript.

### **2. Setting Up**

**a. Naming Convention**:
Rename your CSS file to follow the `.module.css` pattern, e.g., `CourseInput.module.css`.

**b. Importing Styles**:
To use CSS Modules, you import styles as an object:
```javascript
import styles from './CourseInput.module.css';
```

### **3. Examples**

**a. Applying Class to an Element**:

Suppose you have a `.formControl` class in `CourseInput.module.css`.

Usage in a React component:
```javascript
<div className={styles.formControl}>...</div>
```

**b. Dynamic Classes**:
If you have a dynamic condition to apply styles, you can conditionally add classes:

```javascript
<div className={isValid ? styles.formControl : `${styles.formControl} ${styles.invalid}`}>...</div>
```

**c. Using Media Queries**:
CSS Modules allows normal CSS syntax, including media queries.

In `Button.module.css`:
```css
.button {
  width: 100%;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .button {
    width: auto;
  }
}
```

In the component:
```javascript
<button className={styles.button}>Click Me!</button>
```

### **4. Key Takeaways**

- **Scoped Styles**: CSS Modules automatically scopes class names, ensuring no unintentional global side-effects.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Allows you to keep the separation between CSS and JavaScript.
- **Media Queries**: Implement media queries as you normally would in CSS; just remember to include the selector.
- **Flexibility**: While the course uses CSS Modules, you can choose between traditional CSS, Styled Components, or CSS Modules based on your preference.

**Git Reference: React Debugging**

Key Points:
1. Debugging is a crucial skill for React developers.
2. Understanding and handling error messages is essential.
3. Debugging not only includes error messages but also logical errors.
4. Browser developer tools and the browser debugger are useful for debugging.
5. React's Strict Mode can help identify potential issues.
6. React DevTools are essential for debugging React applications.

Example 1 - Error Messages:
- React error messages are crucial for pinpointing issues in your code.
- Example: If you forget to import a component, React might display a message like "ComponentName is not defined," helping you locate the problem.

Example 2 - Logical Errors:
- Logical errors don't always produce error messages but can still impact your app's behavior.
- Example: If a counter in your app increments by 2 instead of 1, this logical error won't trigger an error message but can be identified through debugging.

Example 3 - Browser Developer Tools:
- Using browser developer tools like the Chrome DevTools can help inspect your app's structure and diagnose issues.
- Example: You can inspect the component tree, view state changes, and identify issues in the console.

Example 4 - React Strict Mode:
- React's Strict Mode helps identify potential problems during development.
- Example: It can detect unsafe lifecycle methods and warn you about them, helping you write cleaner and safer code.

Example 5 - React DevTools:
- React DevTools is a browser extension for inspecting and profiling React components.
- Example: With React DevTools, you can examine component hierarchies, see component props and state, and even time performance of your app's rendering.



# 2

**Git Reference: React Error Debugging**

Key Points:
1. React error messages provide valuable information to identify and fix issues.
2. The main error message is often the starting point for debugging.
3. Error messages include a stack trace to pinpoint the source of the problem.
4. Stack traces provide information about the function, line, and column where the error occurred.
5. The example error message identifies an issue with an undefined value and an access problem.
6. By following the stack trace, you can locate the source of the error in your code.
7. In the example, a "results" array is empty due to a negative "duration" value.
8. A guard clause with an "if" check can prevent further execution when necessary.
9. Providing user-friendly error messages improves the user experience.

Example:
- Error Message: "Uncalled type error - Failed to read valueEndOfYear property on an undefined value."
- Stack Trace: Results component function (Line 8) is the source of the error.
- Debugging: The "results" array is empty due to a negative "duration." A guard clause prevents further execution and displays a user-friendly error message instead.


# 3
**Git Reference: Debugging Logical Errors in React**

Key Points:
1. Not all errors in your code produce error messages; logical errors can occur silently.
2. When encountering logical errors, start by thinking logically about which part of your code could be responsible.
3. Use browser developer tools like Chrome DevTools to inspect and debug your code.
4. You can place breakpoints in your code to pause execution at specific points.
5. When debugging, you can hover over variables to view their values at each step.
6. In the example, a logical error occurred when using a string value in mathematical calculations.
7. To fix the error, convert the string value to a number using the `+` operator.

Example:
- Logical Error: Calculations produce unexpected results without displaying error messages.
- Debugging Process: Placing a breakpoint in the code and inspecting variables revealed that the initial investment value was stored as a string. When used in calculations, it led to incorrect results. Adding a `+` before the variable converted it to a number, fixing the issue.

Note: The process involves logical reasoning and the use of developer tools to identify and fix errors that don't generate error messages.


Adding breakpoints in Chrome DevTools is a straightforward process. Follow these simple instructions:

1. **Open DevTools**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Cmd + Option + I on Mac) to open Chrome DevTools. You can also right-click on your web page and select "Inspect."

2. **Navigate to the Source Tab**: In DevTools, click on the "Source" tab. This tab allows you to view and interact with your JavaScript code.

3. **Select the File**: In the left sidebar of the "Source" tab, find and select the JavaScript file you want to debug.

4. **Add a Breakpoint**: In the selected file, locate the line where you want to add a breakpoint. Click on the line number on the left-hand side of the code. A blue marker will appear, indicating the breakpoint.

5. **Run Your Code**: Reload your web page or perform the actions that trigger the JavaScript code you've set a breakpoint in.

6. **Pause at the Breakpoint**: When your code execution reaches the breakpoint, Chrome DevTools will pause execution, and you can inspect variables and step through your code using the controls provided.

7. **Inspect Variables**: While paused at a breakpoint, you can hover over variables to see their current values or use the DevTools console to interact with them.

8. **Resume Execution**: Continue executing your code by clicking the "Play" button or pressing `F8`. Your code will run until the next breakpoint or until completion.

By following these steps, you can effectively use breakpoints in Chrome DevTools to debug your JavaScript code.



# 4
**Git Reference: Using React StrictMode for Error Detection**

Key Points:
1. React's StrictMode is a feature to help catch and fix errors in your application.
2. StrictMode executes component functions twice during development.
3. It can be wrapped around the root component or specific parts of your application.
4. One of its key functions is identifying problems that might not be immediately apparent.
5. In the example, using StrictMode revealed a problem with the Results component causing an array to grow indefinitely.
6. Moving code inside the component function ensured that a new array is created upon each component execution.

Example:
- Using React StrictMode, any issues in your app, such as unintended side effects or data mutations, become immediately apparent. In the example, an array that should be reset with each component execution was growing uncontrollably, causing a table to expand. Moving the code inside the component function resolved the issue.


Certainly! Here's a simplified code example of using React StrictMode to detect and fix errors:

```jsx
import React, { StrictMode } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Results component
function Results() {
  const resultsArray = []; // This should be recreated on each component execution

  // ... Code that adds elements to resultsArray

  return (
    <div>
      {resultsArray.map((result, index) => (
        <div key={index}>{result}</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Investment Calculator</h1>
      <Results />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

In this code:

- We have a `Results` component that maintains an array (`resultsArray`) to store results. However, the `resultsArray` should be recreated on each component execution to avoid accumulating data.

- By wrapping our `App` component in `StrictMode`, React will execute every component function twice during development.

- As a result, the error of the `resultsArray` growing uncontrollably will be immediately apparent because the `Results` component will start with twice the data.

- To fix the issue, move the `resultsArray` initialization inside the `Results` component, ensuring it's recreated with each component execution.


# 5
**Git Reference: Using React Developer Tools**

Key Points:
1. React Developer Tools is a browser extension to aid React development.
2. Install it by searching for "React devtools" and adding it to your browser.
3. It adds two tabs in your browser's developer tools: "Profiler" and "Components."
4. The "Components" tab displays your application's component tree, allowing you to inspect and edit components.
5. Hovering over a component highlights it in the UI, helping with complex component hierarchies.
6. You can control the appearance of the developer tools through settings.
7. Clicking on a component reveals its accepted props and state values, which can be edited to observe UI changes.

Example:
- React Developer Tools lets you inspect and edit component props and state. For instance, you can change the state value of a component using the extension and immediately see how it affects the UI. This tool is invaluable for component tree visualization and interactive debugging.




# 6
**Git Reference: Refs and Portals in React**

Key Points:
1. This course section covers Refs and Portals, advanced React concepts for specific use cases.
2. Refs provide direct access to DOM elements and can manage non-state values.
3. Refs allow components to expose callable functions to other components.
4. Portals detach the rendering location of an element in the DOM from its JSX placement.
5. A demo project will demonstrate how to use Refs and Portals effectively.
6. The example will start with a basic app and a player component with non-functional features, which will be improved step by step.

Example:
- In the demo project, you will learn how to use Refs to make the "Set Name" input functional, providing an initial practical use case for the concept of Refs.
# 7
Key Points:
- The goal is to allow a user to set their name and display it.
- Initially, the component should display "unknown entity."
- To do this without using Refs, you can use the `useState` hook.
- You track the entered name in state with `useState`.
- Use the `handleChange` function connected to the input's `onChange` prop to update the state as the user types.
- Use the `handleClick` function connected to the button's `onClick` prop to set a "submitted" state to true and conditionally render the entered name.
- If "submitted" is true, display the entered name; otherwise, show "unknown entity."

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function PlayerComponent() {
  const [enteredPlayerName, setEnteredPlayerName] = useState('');
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setEnteredPlayerName(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleClick = () => {
    setSubmitted(true);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" onChange={handleChange} value={enteredPlayerName} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Set Name</button>
      <p>Welcome {submitted ? enteredPlayerName : 'unknown entity'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default PlayerComponent;
```

This code allows you to set your name, and after clicking the "Set Name" button, it displays a welcome message with your name. If the name is not set, it shows "unknown entity."

# 8 

Key Points:
- In JSX, you must have only one root element within a component.
- Trying to return or use multiple root elements directly will cause an error.
- A common solution is to wrap multiple elements in a `<div>` to create a single root element.
- React offers a better solution: the "React Fragment."
- A React Fragment allows you to group elements without adding an extra DOM element.
- Import it and use it as `<Fragment>` or use the shorter form `<>...</>` (no import needed).

Example:
```jsx
import { Fragment } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>React is awesome!</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```
Or using the shorter form:
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>React is awesome!</p>
    </>
  );
}
```


# 9
Key Points:
- Refs in React are special values managed by React for interacting with the DOM.
- Create a ref using the `useRef` hook.
- Connect the ref to JSX elements using the `ref` prop.
- To access the element connected to the ref, use the `refName.current` property.
- For input elements, you can access their properties and methods through the ref.
- Great for use cases where you want to read values from DOM elements.

Example:
```jsx
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const playerNameRef = useRef();
  const [enteredPlayerName, setEnteredPlayerName] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    const playerName = playerNameRef.current.value;
    setEnteredPlayerName(playerName);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={playerNameRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Set Name</button>
      <p>{enteredPlayerName ?? 'unknown entity'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we use a ref to directly access the value of the input element, simplifying the component.



Refs in React serve a different purpose than state and offer some capabilities that state cannot provide. Here are some key differences and use cases for refs:

1. Direct DOM Access: Refs allow you to interact directly with DOM elements. You can read or modify DOM properties and methods using refs, which is not possible with state alone.

2. Focusing and Managing Input Elements: You can use refs to focus input elements, trigger animations, or perform other DOM-related actions. For example, you can programmatically focus an input field, which is not easily achievable with state alone.

3. Integrating with Third-Party Libraries: Refs are useful when integrating React with third-party libraries (like jQuery or D3) that rely on direct DOM manipulation. You can use refs to manage React components that wrap or interface with these libraries.

4. Measuring Elements: If you need to measure the size or position of a DOM element, you can use refs to access the underlying DOM node and gather measurements. This is especially useful for creating responsive components.

5. Interaction with Canvas or Media Elements: When working with `<canvas>` elements, video players, or audio players, you often need direct control. Refs are valuable for such cases, as you can interact with the underlying media elements or the canvas context directly.

6. Bypassing React's Reconciliation: Refs allow you to bypass React's virtual DOM reconciliation process in some cases. For instance, you can update the DOM element without causing React to re-render the entire component tree.

7. Optimizing Performance: In situations where you want to optimize performance, you can use refs to prevent unnecessary re-renders by controlling when and how components update. This can be crucial for performance-sensitive applications.

It's important to note that while refs provide these advantages, they should be used sparingly, and React's state management, props, and component lifecycle methods should still be your primary tools for managing your application's behavior. Refs are typically used for specific cases that require direct interaction with the DOM or other non-React parts of your application.


# 10
**Key Points:**

- React promotes declarative code, avoiding direct DOM manipulation.
- While using refs to directly manipulate DOM elements can be handy in specific cases, it should be used with caution.
- In the provided example, clearing an input field is demonstrated using a ref, bypassing React's declarative approach.
- Refs are useful for certain use cases, but overusing them for complex DOM interactions may go against React's principles.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function App() {
  const playerNameRef = useRef();

  const handleSetPlayerName = () => {
    const inputElement = playerNameRef.current;
    if (inputElement) {
      inputElement.value = ''; // Imperatively clear the input field
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={playerNameRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleSetPlayerName}>Set Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the example, a ref (`playerNameRef`) is used to directly clear the input field when the "Set Name" button is clicked. While this approach can be convenient for simple tasks like clearing an input, it involves imperative code and should be used judiciously within the declarative React paradigm.
# 11
