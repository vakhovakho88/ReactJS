* Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code and NodeJS.

* We can train next-gen-js on the website: https://jsbin.com/
* Change the language to ES6/Babel

# Next-Gen-Javascript

* let - Declaration of mutable  variables
* const - Declaration of immutable variables


#### Functions old school
```javascript
function printTheNumber(x){
    console.log(x);
}
```


#### Arrow functions
```javascript
const printTheNumber= (x)=>{
    console.log(x);
}
```
- let keyword could be used too if we wanted to make it reassignable
- If arrow function has only one parameter, we can write it without parantheses
- In another case we need parantheses

#### Arrow functions on one line

```javascript
const multiply = (x,y) => x*y;

const squareIt = x => x*x;
```

### Export & Imports (Modules)
* The idea is that, we split code in modules


#### Default export
```javascript

//person.js
const person = {
    name: 'Max'
} 
export default person;

```
* Default export means that this object will be exported automatically 
* Ir does not matter what we name it during import



```javascript

//app.js
//default export
import person from './person.js'
import prs from './person.js'


```

####  Named export
```javascript
//utility.js
export const clean = () => {console.log("Test")}
export const basedata = 10;
```
* We shoult import objects with names, we could give it alliases and import everything together
```javascript
//named export
import {clean} from './utility.js'
import {clean as cln} from './utility.js'
import * as myObject from './utility.js'
```




## Classes

* Classes are Blueprints of Javascript objects
* Classes contains members an methods
* Let us Create a simple Class with a Constructor and simple Method, Name is a member
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(){
    this.name='Vakho';
  }
  
  printMyName(){
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

// Making an Object and call the method.
const person = new Person();
person.printMyName();

```

* Another basic feature of classes ist Inheritence. Let us make a Person Class that inherites from Human class.
* Dont forget to call super() in the child class, it calls a constructor of a parent class

```javascript

//this is a parent class
class Human {
  constructor(){
    this.gender='Male';
  }
  
  printGender(){
    console.log(this.gender);
  }
}

//this is a class that inherites from parent class
class Person extends Human{
  constructor(){
    //super ist a call of parent constructor, and it is very important.
    super();
    this.name='Vakho';
  }
  
  printMyName(){
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

// Object of the class, as we see it it contains everything from parent class too
const person = new Person();
person.printMyName();
person.printGender();

```

* We can change members of parent class in child classes too.
* Let us see a different syntax to initialize properties and methods
* In this case we can have Properties without constructor and have methods with arrow functions.

```javascript
class Human {
  //Member
  gender = 'Male';
  //Arrow Funtion
  printGender = () => {
    console.log(this.gender);
  }
}





class Person extends Human{
  //Member
  name = 'Vakho'
  
  //arrow funtion
  printMyName = () =>{
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

const person = new Person();
person.printMyName();
person.printGender();

```
* In the functionality above doesnot change anything.



#### Spread and Rest operator
* it is only "..." operator
* Spread operator could be used to spread array or object elements
```javascript
//Spreading Array

const oldArray = [1,2,3]; 
const newArray  = [...oldArray,4,5]

console.log(newArray)

//output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

```javascript
//Spreading an Object
const oldObject  = {name:'Vakho'}
const newObject = {...oldObject, height:180}

console.log(newObject)

//output:
[object Object] {
  height: 180,
  name: "Vakho"
}
```

* Rest operator lets a funtion to see arguments as an array
```javascript
//filter array elements and only return elements if they are equal to 1
const filter = (...args)=>{
  return args.filter(elem => elem ===1);
}

console.log(filter(1,2,3,4))

//output:
[1]


```

#### Destructuring
* Destructuring means taking an array/object elements out and assign it to a variable
* Destructuring an array
```javascript
const numbers = [1,2,3];
[x,y] = numbers; // x=1, y=2

[,y] = numbers; // y = 2

[,,y] = numbers; // y = 3

[x,,y] = numbers; //x=1, y = 3

[x,y,z] = numbers; // x=1,y=2,z=3
```

* Destructuring an Object

```javascript
const person  = {name:'Vakho', height:180};

{name, age} = person;  //name = "Vakho", height = 180

```

#### Primitive and Reference types

* If we assign a primitive type object to another primitiv type object its value will be copied
* In Javascript objects and array are reference types, it means it will not be copied automatically
```javascript

const person = {name = "Vakho"};
const person2 = person;
```
* In the example above, person2 is not a copie of person. it just references it. It means, if we change person2 it changes person.
* If we want to avoid data loss, we can copie an object or array with spread operator
```javascript
const person = {name = "Vakho"};
const person2 = {...person}; // this is a copie
```

#### Map

* Map is an array funtion that  allows us to go throug all array elements and make some operations and return them after edit
* The original array would not be changed





```javascript
const numbers = [1,2,3,4];
//double all elements of an array
const doubleNumArray = numbers.map((num)=> {return num*2;})

console.log(doubleNumArray)
//output:
[2, 4, 6, 8]

```
