## User Interaction and State

### Making Apps interactive and Reactive

- Handling user Events
- Updating UI & Working with "State"
- Closer look At components and State

#### Listening to Events & Working with Event Handlers

- Let us add a Button and eventlistener to our component

```javascript
...
 <button onClick={()=>console.log("Clicked")}>Change Title</button>
 ...
```

- As we see it we use here inline arrow function
- It must not be an arrow function it could be a function with function keyword too
- If we should see in Developer Tools we should see the output.

- But we should never use inline functions, it is better that we define an extra function inside a component function and give it as a REFERENCE to the event
- In this case we are using local functions (Function in the function)

```javascript
const ExpenseItem = (props) => {
  //...
  const clickHandler = () =>{
    console.log("Clicked");
  }

  return (
    <Card className="expense-item">
    <!-- ... -->
      <button onClick={clickHandler}>Change Title</button>
    </Card>
  );
}

```

- onClick={clickHandler} and not onClick={clickHandler()}
- If we had written onClick={clickHandler()}, js would call it after rendering it
- It means we should give it as a reference
- It is better to have it named with ending Handler

#### How Component Functions Are Executed

- React Renders Components one time and doesnot repeat it
- It means if we change prop values it will not be automatically updatet on The UI
- Example

```javascript
let expenseTitle = "Title";

const clickHandler = () => {
  expenseTitle = "Title Changed";
};

return (
  //..
  <h2>{expenseTitle}</h2>
  //..
);
```

- React renders h2 with a value of "Title"
- After clicking the button that calls "clickHandler()" the value of a variable changes but the value of h2 doesnot
- As we mentioned react renders only one Time and if we want to update Rendered value we need STATES

#### State

- To change a value of UI elements we need to use useState hook
- This is one of many hooks from react

```javascript
import { React, useState } from "react";
```

- Call it global to the body of component function

```javascript
const [expenseTitle, setTitle] = useState(props.title);
```

- It takes a prop as an argument and returns array of two elements
- First element is a value of the prop and the second element is a function that can be used to change a value of the prop and it causes changing UI element too
- As we have seen it, we use array destructuring
- And then we can call it from the eventhandler and it updates the ui too, where this prop is located

```javascript
const clickHandler = () => {
  setTitle("Changed Value");
};
```

- For every new component is a new instance of this hook created
- It will rerender and recall this concrete instance, if the value of prop is changed
- Why do we use const variables?
- The answer is simple, we want that we don assign value to it with "="
- To assigt value we use react hook setTitle

#### NewExpense Component

- let us create new Expense compinent through that we add new expense
- It should be just a normal html form
- ![newexpense folder structure](dokus\7_newExpense.png)
- ExpenseForm

```javascript
//this is a form tu submit new expense
// this form is located in the container NewExpense
import React from "react";
import "./ExpenseForm.css";

const ExpenseForm = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      <div className="new-expense__controls">
        <div className="new-expense__control">
          <label>Title</label>
          <input type="text" />
        </div>

        <div className="new-expense__control">
          <label>Amount</label>
          <input type="number" min="0.01" step="0.01" />
        </div>

        <div className="new-expense__control">
          <label>Title</label>
          <input type="date" min="2019-01-01" max="2024-12-31" />
        </div>

        <button type="submit">Add Expense</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
};

export default ExpenseForm;
```

- New Expense is just a wrapper component for expenseform

```javascript
import React from "react";
import "./NewExpense.css";
import ExpenseForm from "./ExpenseForm";

const NewExpense = () => {
  return (
    <div className="new-expense">
      <ExpenseForm />
    </div>
  );
};
export default NewExpense;
```

- App.js

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <NewExpense />
    <Expenses items={expenses} />
  </div>
);
```


#### Listening to user inputs

- A form element, from that we want to catch a value

```javascript
 //We want to catch the value on input change
 <input type="text" onChange={titleChangeHandler} />

```
- Implementation of Eventhandler in the same Component Function
- this functions prints the value of an input on the console
```javascript
  //eventhandler thal listens to title change in the form
  //event object commes here automatically
  //event.target -> the object, that called an event
  const titleChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    console.log(event.target.value);
  };


```

- The code below shows the peaces how eventhandlers are used. 

```javascript
const ExpenseForm = () => {

  //for all three values let us create a separate state.
  //this creates custom states without props.
  const [enteredTitle, setEnteredTitle] = useState('');
  const [enteredAmount, setenteredAmount] = useState('');
  const [enteredDate, setEnteredDate] = useState('');

  //eventhandler thal listens to title change in the form
  //event object commes here automatically
  //event.target -> the object, that called an event
  const titleChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    setEnteredTitle(event.target.value);
    console.log(enteredTitle);
  };

  const amountChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    setenteredAmount(event.target.value);
    console.log(enteredAmount);
  };

  const dateChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    setEnteredDate(event.target.value);
    console.log(enteredDate);
  };


  return (
    ...
          <input type="text" onChange={titleChangeHandler} />
    ...  
          <input type="number" min="0.01" step="0.01" onChange={amountChangeHandler}/>
    ...
          <input type="date" min="2019-01-01" max="2024-12-31" onChange={dateChangeHandler}/>
    ... 
  );
};

export default ExpenseForm;

```


### Use one state object instead of 3 separate variables
- We can have multiple slices but we could have one state instead of 3 states 
- We could call a state only once and give it an object with 3 members
- Wenever we update one object member we should update all of them
- We can use Spread operator to extract old values of the object
- We can just decide wich approach we use


### instead of three states we could have just one object, one state approach
  
```javascript
  const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState({
    enteredTitle: '',
    enteredAmount: '',
    enteredDate: ''
  });

```
#### Change a value of an object element (Spread Operator)
```javascript

    setUserInput(
      {
        ...userInput,
        enteredTitle: event.target.value
      }
    );



```

#### Change a value with arrow function, we should use this approach, if new state depends on previous state. We could achieve a bette scheduling with this approach.
####  React Schedules state update, with this approach we can be sure, that it is the latests snapshot of the state

```javascript

setUserInput((prevState)=>{
      return {...prevState, enteredTitle:event.target.value};
    });
    console.log(userInput.enteredTitle);


```


#### Handling form submission
- Create eventlistener
- Call eventlistener from form
- preVentDefault function prevents a browser to reload an antire page


```javascript
  const submitHandler = (event)=>{
    // To prevent reloading of the page after submiting (After we click submit button)
    event.preventDefault();

    // create an Object that will be used for Submitting
    const expenseData = {
      title: enteredTitle,
      amount: enteredAmount,
      date: new Date(enteredDate)
    }
    console.log(expenseData)

  };

 return (
    <form onSubmit={submitHandler}>
      .........

```

#### Two way binding
- For the inputs we are listening to changes and if a value of the state is changed, we pass a new value  back into the input.
- it is just simple code change with value attribute 
```javascript
<input type="text" onChange={titleChangeHandler}  value={enteredTitle}/>
```

#### Child-to-Parent Component Communication
- Till now we have learned, how to pass data down (We can do that with Props)
- If we want to send data from child component to parent component, we should pass a function from parent component to a child component ad call this function there. 
```javascript
// NewExpense: Parent component, ExpenseForm: cild component

//NewExpense.js
    //this function will be executed in the child component, 
    //With this approach we can achieve down up data transfer
    const saveExpenseDatahandler = (enteredExpenseData)=>{
        const epxensedData = {
            // fetching data
            ...enteredExpenseData,
            id: Math.random().toString()
        };
        //this funtion passes data to upper component in the chain
        props.onAddExpense(epxensedData);
    };

    return (
            // saveExpenseDatahandler: function pointer for the child component
            <ExpenseForm onSaveExpenseData = {saveExpenseDatahandler}/>
    );


// ExpenseForm.js

    //in the submition of the form:

    //two way Binding, clear the inputs after submition
    setEnteredTitle('');
    setenteredAmount('');
    setEnteredDate('');
    //this funtion passes data to upper component in the chain
    props.onSaveExpenseData(expenseData); 

```


#### If we want to send data to sibling component:
- Send Data from Child to Parent component
- Send data from Parent to another Child component


### Add ExpensesFilter to our expenses

- Adding a new Component "ExpensesFilter"
- This component contains DropDownMenu and eventhandler if the Value of DropdownMenu is changed
- Add this Component in Expenses.js 
- Expenses.js gives a funtion reference to the child component
- The given function reference will be called in the child component
#### Expenses.js
```javascript
  //2020 initial value
  const [filteredYear, setFilteredYear] = useState('2020');
  const filterChangeHandler = selectedYear => {
    setFilteredYear(selectedYear);
  }

  ...

  return (
    <div>
    <Card className="expenses">
    <ExpensesFilter selected={filteredYear} onChangeFilter={filterChangeHandler}/>
    ...

```
#### ExpensesFilter.js
```javascript
const ExpensesFilter = (props) => {
  const dropdownChangeHandler = (event) => {
    props.onChangeFilter(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div className='expenses-filter'>
      <div className='expenses-filter__control'>
        <label>Filter by year</label>
        <select value={props.selected} onChange={dropdownChangeHandler}>
          <option value='2022'>2022</option>
          <option value='2021'>2021</option>
          <option value='2020'>2020</option>
          <option value='2019'>2019</option>
        </select>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

```

#### Derived/Computed state
- If we assign a state to a normal variable, it will be automatically updated after the state is updated


#### Controlled Component: If the values of states are not handled in the component self but in the parent component
#### Presentational (Stateless, Dumb) vs Statefull (smart) Component if there are states managed in the component 
- Your most components should be Presentational to manage states better

# Child-to-Parent Communication in React (Functional Components)

## Overview

In React, components often need to communicate with each other to share data or trigger actions. While data typically flows down from parent to child components through props, there are instances where the child needs to send information back up to the parent. This document outlines the child-to-parent communication pattern using functional components and hooks in React.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of React functional components.
- Familiarity with React hooks, especially `useState`.

## Concepts

### useState Hook

The `useState` hook is a fundamental React hook used to add state to functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it.

### Props

Props are a way of passing data from parent to child components in React. They are read-only and help in creating reusable components.

## Child-to-Parent Communication Steps

1. **Parent Component Setup**: The parent component defines a state and a function to update this state. This update function will be passed down to the child component as a prop.

2. **Passing the Update Function**: The update function is passed to the child component through props, allowing the child to trigger updates in the parent's state.

3. **Child Component Interaction**: The child component invokes the received function, optionally passing data back to the parent, thereby enabling communication from child to parent.

## Example

### Parent Component

The ParentComponent defines a message state and a function `handleMessage` to update this state. It passes `handleMessage` to the ChildComponent.

```jsx
// ParentComponent.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const handleMessage = (childMessage) => {
    setMessage(childMessage);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <ChildComponent onMessageSend={handleMessage} />
      <p>Message from Child: {message}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

### Child Component

The ChildComponent receives the `onMessageSend` function as a prop and calls it upon a button click event, sending a message back to the ParentComponent.

```jsx
// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ onMessageSend }) => {
  const sendMessage = () => {
    onMessageSend('Hello from the Child!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Child Component</h2>
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send Message to Parent</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChildComponent;
```

## Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for callback functions and props to indicate their purpose and direction of data flow.
- **Single Responsibility**: Components should ideally have a single responsibility. Keep the communication pattern simple and focused on specific actions.
- **Prop Drilling**: For deep component trees, consider using context or state management libraries to avoid excessive prop drilling.

## Conclusion

Child-to-parent communication in React functional components is achieved through the use of props and callback functions. This pattern is essential for creating interactive and dynamic applications with components that need to communicate upwards in the component hierarchy.

## Example 2

### Scenario: Toggling a Theme

In this example, we'll create a simple application that allows the user to toggle between a Light and Dark theme using a child component. The parent component will adjust the application's theme based on the selection.

#### Parent Component (App.js)

The `App` component will hold the state for the current theme and render the `ThemeToggle` child component, passing it a function to update the theme.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light'); // Default theme is light

  const toggleTheme = (selectedTheme) => {
    setTheme(selectedTheme);
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333', color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' }}>
      <h1>{`Current Theme: ${theme}`}</h1>
      <ThemeToggle onToggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Child Component (ThemeToggle.js)

The `ThemeToggle` component will render a button that, when clicked, toggles the theme between Light and Dark. It calls the `onToggleTheme` function passed from the parent with the new theme value.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ThemeToggle = ({ onToggleTheme }) => {
  const toggle = () => {
    onToggleTheme(prevTheme => prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle Theme</button>
  );
};

export default ThemeToggle;
```

### Explanation

- **Parent Component (App.js)**: Maintains the current theme state and provides a method to update this state (`toggleTheme`). It also applies the current theme's styles dynamically based on the state.
- **Child Component (ThemeToggle.js)**: Contains a button to toggle the theme. It doesn't maintain any state related to the theme itself; instead, it notifies the parent component about the desire to change the theme using the `onToggleTheme` function received via props.

### Key Takeaways

- The child component communicates a change back to the parent component without directly managing the application's state.
- This pattern demonstrates how a functional child component can influence the state of its parent component through callback functions, allowing for modular and reusable component design.
- The use of a functional update (`onToggleTheme(prevTheme => ...)`) is a best practice when the new state depends on the previous state, ensuring the update is based on the most current state.

This example showcases a practical use of child-to-parent communication in React, facilitating state management across components and enhancing the application's interactivity and responsiveness to user inputs.


## Example 3
For a succinct example, let's consider a case where a child component is responsible for capturing user input and then passing that input back up to the parent component, where it's displayed.

### Scenario: User Input Submission

#### Parent Component (UserInputDisplay.js)

The parent component maintains the user's input as state and displays it. It provides a function to the child component to update this state based on the input received.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import InputField from './InputField';

const UserInputDisplay = () => {
  const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');

  const handleUserInput = (input) => {
    setUserInput(input);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Input:</h2>
      <p>{userInput}</p>
      <InputField onUpdateInput={handleUserInput} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserInputDisplay;
```

#### Child Component (InputField.js)

The child component renders an input field. When the user types in this field, the component calls the `onUpdateInput` function provided by the parent, passing the current input value back to the parent.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const InputField = ({ onUpdateInput }) => {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      onChange={(e) => onUpdateInput(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Type something..."
    />
  );
};

export default InputField;
```

### Key Points

- **State Management in Parent**: The `UserInputDisplay` component manages the state for the user input and passes a handler function to the child component to update this state.
- **Data Flow from Child to Parent**: The `InputField` component receives user input and uses the provided function to communicate this input back to the parent component.
- **Decoupling Components**: This pattern keeps the child component decoupled from the parent, allowing for reuse of the `InputField` component in different contexts.




# Event Handling in React with Functional Components

This document focuses on understanding how to handle events in React functional components. React simplifies event handling by providing a synthetic event system, ensuring consistency across various browsers and simplifying the process for developers. In functional components, hooks and arrow functions often facilitate event handling, making the syntax and usage more straightforward compared to class components.

2. [Basic Event Handling](#basic-event-handling)
3. [Passing Arguments to Event Handlers](#passing-arguments-to-event-handlers)

5. [Event Types](#event-types)
6. [Best Practices](#best-practices)
7. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Introduction

Event handling in React functional components involves attaching event listeners to JSX elements and defining functions that will be executed when those events are triggered. Events are named using camelCase, and functions are passed directly as event handlers.

## Basic Event Handling

To handle an event, define a function that will be called when the event occurs and pass it to the appropriate JSX element's event attribute.

### Example: Click Event

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

export default App;
```

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

Sometimes, you need to pass an argument to an event handler. This can be achieved using an arrow function to wrap the event handler call, allowing you to pass custom arguments.

### Example: Passing Data

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const handleItemClick = (item) => {
    console.log('Item clicked:', item);
  };

  return (
    <ul>
      <li onClick={() => handleItemClick('Item 1')}>Item 1</li>
      <li onClick={() => handleItemClick('Item 2')}>Item 2</li>
    </ul>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Using the `useState` Hook

The `useState` hook can be used in conjunction with event handlers to update component state based on user interactions.

### Example: Toggling State

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ToggleButton() {
  const [isToggled, setIsToggled] = useState(false);

  const toggle = () => {
    setIsToggled(!isToggled);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={toggle}>
      {isToggled ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
    </button>
  );
}

export default ToggleButton;
```

## Event Types

React supports a wide range of events, including but not limited to:

- **onClick**: Triggered by clicking on an element.
- **onChange**: Fires when the value of an input, select, or textarea is changed.
- **onSubmit**: Occurs when a form is submitted.
- **onMouseOver** / **onMouseOut**: Mouse pointer moves over/out of an element.
- **onFocus** / **onBlur**: Element gains/loses focus.

## Best Practices

- **Use arrow functions for event handlers** to avoid issues with `this` binding.
- **Prevent default behavior** in form submission handlers with `event.preventDefault()`.
- **Optimize performance** by avoiding inline function definitions in JSX when possible, especially in components that render large lists or tables.

## Conclusion

Handling events in React functional components is straightforward and intuitive. By following the examples and best practices outlined in this document, developers can effectively manage user interactions and state changes within their React applications, leading to dynamic and responsive user experiences.


Here are five examples illustrating different aspects of event handling in React functional components, showcasing various events and techniques for managing user interactions.

### 1. Handling Click Events

This example demonstrates handling a button click event to toggle visibility of a message.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ToggleMessage() {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}>Toggle Message</button>
      {isVisible && <p>Hello, World!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ToggleMessage;
```

### 2. Handling Form Submission

In this example, a form submission event is handled to prevent the default form submit action and log input data.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function FormSubmit() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
    console.log('Submitted value:', inputValue);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default FormSubmit;
```

### 3. Handling Mouse Enter and Leave Events

This example shows how to change the state when the mouse enters or leaves an element.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function HoverEffect() {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
      style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: isHovered ? '#f0f0f0' : '#fff' }}
    >
      {isHovered ? 'Mouse is over me!' : 'Hover over me!'}
    </div>
  );
}

export default HoverEffect;
```

### 4. Handling Change Events on Input

This example demonstrates handling change events in an input field to update state with the input value.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function InputChange() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Current Value: {value}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default InputChange;
```

### 5. Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

This example illustrates how to pass additional arguments to an event handler function, such as an item id in a list.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ListItem({ item }) {
  const handleItemClick = (itemId, e) => {
    console.log(`Item ${itemId} clicked`, e);
  };

  return (
    <li onClick={(e) => handleItemClick(item.id, e)}>
      {item.name}
    </li>
  );
}

function ItemList() {
  const items = [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }];

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <ListItem key={item.id} item={item} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default ItemList;
```

Each of these examples showcases a different facet of event handling in React, from basic click events to more complex scenarios involving passing arguments and managing form submissions, providing a broad overview of interaction patterns within React applications.




# Two-Way Data Binding in ReactJS

Two-way data binding in ReactJS refers to the technique of binding your UI elements to your application state. ReactJS primarily follows a unidirectional data flow, but two-way data binding can be achieved using controlled components. Here, the form elements are controlled by React state, and updates to the form fields are reflected in the state, enabling an interactive and dynamic user experience.

## Implementing Two-Way Data Binding

### Example 1: Basic Text Input

A simple text input where the input value is controlled by React's state.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TextInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

### Example 2: Checkbox

Managing a checkbox's checked state through React state.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function CheckboxInput() {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);

  const handleChange = () => {
    setChecked(!checked);
  };

  return <input type="checkbox" checked={checked} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

### Example 3: Select Dropdown

A dropdown (select) where the selected option is bound to the component's state.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function SelectInput() {
  const [selectedValue, setSelectedValue] = useState('option1');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setSelectedValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <select value={selectedValue} onChange={handleChange}>
      <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
      <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
    </select>
  );
}
```

### Example 4: Handling Multiple Inputs

Using a single handler to manage the state of multiple form elements.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MultipleInputs() {
  const [inputs, setInputs] = useState({ name: '', age: '' });

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target;
    setInputs((prevState) => ({
      ...prevState,
      [name]: value,
    }));
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <input
        name="name"
        type="text"
        value={inputs.name}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      <input
        name="age"
        type="number"
        value={inputs.age}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Example 5: Radio Buttons Group

Controlling a group of radio buttons where only one can be selected at a time.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function RadioButtonGroup() {
  const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState('option1');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setSelectedOption(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <input
        type="radio"
        value="option1"
        checked={selectedOption === 'option1'}
        onChange={handleChange}
      /> Option 1
      <input
        type="radio"
        value="option2"
        checked={selectedOption === 'option2'}
        onChange={handleChange}
      /> Option 2
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Two-way data binding in ReactJS enables the creation of interactive forms by syncing the UI with the component's state. This pattern is especially useful in forms and settings where immediate feedback and data persistence are required. By controlling form elements through state and handling their changes, React apps can achieve dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
