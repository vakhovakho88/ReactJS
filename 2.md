## User Interaction and State

### Making Apps interactive and Reactive

- Handling user Events
- Updating UI & Working with "State"
- Closer look At components and State

#### Listening to Events & Working with Event Handlers

- Let us add a Button and eventlistener to our component

```javascript
...
 <button onClick={()=>console.log("Clicked")}>Change Title</button>
 ...
```

- As we see it we use here inline arrow function
- It must not be an arrow function it could be a function with function keyword too
- If we should see in Developer Tools we should see the output.

- But we should never use inline functions, it is better that we define an extra function inside a component function and give it as a REFERENCE to the event
- In this case we are using local functions (Function in the function)

```javascript
const ExpenseItem = (props) => {
  //...
  const clickHandler = () =>{
    console.log("Clicked");
  }

  return (
    <Card className="expense-item">
    <!-- ... -->
      <button onClick={clickHandler}>Change Title</button>
    </Card>
  );
}

```

- onClick={clickHandler} and not onClick={clickHandler()}
- If we had written onClick={clickHandler()}, js would call it after rendering it
- It means we should give it as a reference
- It is better to have it named with ending Handler

#### How Component Functions Are Executed

- React Renders Components one time and doesnot repeat it
- It means if we change prop values it will not be automatically updatet on The UI
- Example

```javascript
let expenseTitle = "Title";

const clickHandler = () => {
  expenseTitle = "Title Changed";
};

return (
  //..
  <h2>{expenseTitle}</h2>
  //..
);
```

- React renders h2 with a value of "Title"
- After clicking the button that calls "clickHandler()" the value of a variable changes but the value of h2 doesnot
- As we mentioned react renders only one Time and if we want to update Rendered value we need STATES

#### State

- To change a value of UI elements we need to use useState hook
- This is one of many hooks from react

```javascript
import { React, useState } from "react";
```

- Call it global to the body of component function

```javascript
const [expenseTitle, setTitle] = useState(props.title);
```

- It takes a prop as an argument and returns array of two elements
- First element is a value of the prop and the second element is a function that can be used to change a value of the prop and it causes changing UI element too
- As we have seen it, we use array destructuring
- And then we can call it from the eventhandler and it updates the ui too, where this prop is located

```javascript
const clickHandler = () => {
  setTitle("Changed Value");
};
```

- For every new component is a new instance of this hook created
- It will rerender and recall this concrete instance, if the value of prop is changed
- Why do we use const variables?
- The answer is simple, we want that we don assign value to it with "="
- To assigt value we use react hook setTitle

#### NewExpense Component

- let us create new Expense compinent through that we add new expense
- It should be just a normal html form
- ![newexpense folder structure](dokus\7_newExpense.png)
- ExpenseForm

```javascript
//this is a form tu submit new expense
// this form is located in the container NewExpense
import React from "react";
import "./ExpenseForm.css";

const ExpenseForm = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      <div className="new-expense__controls">
        <div className="new-expense__control">
          <label>Title</label>
          <input type="text" />
        </div>

        <div className="new-expense__control">
          <label>Amount</label>
          <input type="number" min="0.01" step="0.01" />
        </div>

        <div className="new-expense__control">
          <label>Title</label>
          <input type="date" min="2019-01-01" max="2024-12-31" />
        </div>

        <button type="submit">Add Expense</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
};

export default ExpenseForm;
```

- New Expense is just a wrapper component for expenseform

```javascript
import React from "react";
import "./NewExpense.css";
import ExpenseForm from "./ExpenseForm";

const NewExpense = () => {
  return (
    <div className="new-expense">
      <ExpenseForm />
    </div>
  );
};
export default NewExpense;
```

- App.js

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <NewExpense />
    <Expenses items={expenses} />
  </div>
);
```


#### Listening to user inputs

- A form element, from that we want to catch a value

```javascript
 //We want to catch the value on input change
 <input type="text" onChange={titleChangeHandler} />

```
- Implementation of Eventhandler in the same Component Function
- this functions prints the value of an input on the console
```javascript
  //eventhandler thal listens to title change in the form
  //event object commes here automatically
  //event.target -> the object, that called an event
  const titleChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    console.log(event.target.value);
  };


```

- The code below shows the peaces how eventhandlers are used. 

```javascript
const ExpenseForm = () => {

  //for all three values let us create a separate state.
  //this creates custom states without props.
  const [enteredTitle, setEnteredTitle] = useState('');
  const [enteredAmount, setenteredAmount] = useState('');
  const [enteredDate, setEnteredDate] = useState('');

  //eventhandler thal listens to title change in the form
  //event object commes here automatically
  //event.target -> the object, that called an event
  const titleChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    setEnteredTitle(event.target.value);
    console.log(enteredTitle);
  };

  const amountChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    setenteredAmount(event.target.value);
    console.log(enteredAmount);
  };

  const dateChangeHandler = (event) =>{
    setEnteredDate(event.target.value);
    console.log(enteredDate);
  };


  return (
    ...
          <input type="text" onChange={titleChangeHandler} />
    ...  
          <input type="number" min="0.01" step="0.01" onChange={amountChangeHandler}/>
    ...
          <input type="date" min="2019-01-01" max="2024-12-31" onChange={dateChangeHandler}/>
    ... 
  );
};

export default ExpenseForm;
