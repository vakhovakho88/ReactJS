**Git Reference: Refs and Portals in React**

Key Points:
1. This course section covers Refs and Portals, advanced React concepts for specific use cases.
2. Refs provide direct access to DOM elements and can manage non-state values.
3. Refs allow components to expose callable functions to other components.
4. Portals detach the rendering location of an element in the DOM from its JSX placement.
5. A demo project will demonstrate how to use Refs and Portals effectively.
6. The example will start with a basic app and a player component with non-functional features, which will be improved step by step.

Example:
- In the demo project, you will learn how to use Refs to make the "Set Name" input functional, providing an initial practical use case for the concept of Refs.
# 2
Key Points:
- The goal is to allow a user to set their name and display it.
- Initially, the component should display "unknown entity."
- To do this without using Refs, you can use the `useState` hook.
- You track the entered name in state with `useState`.
- Use the `handleChange` function connected to the input's `onChange` prop to update the state as the user types.
- Use the `handleClick` function connected to the button's `onClick` prop to set a "submitted" state to true and conditionally render the entered name.
- If "submitted" is true, display the entered name; otherwise, show "unknown entity."

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function PlayerComponent() {
  const [enteredPlayerName, setEnteredPlayerName] = useState('');
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setEnteredPlayerName(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleClick = () => {
    setSubmitted(true);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" onChange={handleChange} value={enteredPlayerName} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Set Name</button>
      <p>Welcome {submitted ? enteredPlayerName : 'unknown entity'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default PlayerComponent;
```

This code allows you to set your name, and after clicking the "Set Name" button, it displays a welcome message with your name. If the name is not set, it shows "unknown entity."

# 3 

Key Points:
- In JSX, you must have only one root element within a component.
- Trying to return or use multiple root elements directly will cause an error.
- A common solution is to wrap multiple elements in a `<div>` to create a single root element.
- React offers a better solution: the "React Fragment."
- A React Fragment allows you to group elements without adding an extra DOM element.
- Import it and use it as `<Fragment>` or use the shorter form `<>...</>` (no import needed).

Example:
```jsx
import { Fragment } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>React is awesome!</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```
Or using the shorter form:
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>React is awesome!</p>
    </>
  );
}
```


# 4
Key Points:
- Refs in React are special values managed by React for interacting with the DOM.
- Create a ref using the `useRef` hook.
- Connect the ref to JSX elements using the `ref` prop.
- To access the element connected to the ref, use the `refName.current` property.
- For input elements, you can access their properties and methods through the ref.
- Great for use cases where you want to read values from DOM elements.

Example:
```jsx
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const playerNameRef = useRef();
  const [enteredPlayerName, setEnteredPlayerName] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    const playerName = playerNameRef.current.value;
    setEnteredPlayerName(playerName);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={playerNameRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Set Name</button>
      <p>{enteredPlayerName ?? 'unknown entity'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we use a ref to directly access the value of the input element, simplifying the component.



Refs in React serve a different purpose than state and offer some capabilities that state cannot provide. Here are some key differences and use cases for refs:

1. Direct DOM Access: Refs allow you to interact directly with DOM elements. You can read or modify DOM properties and methods using refs, which is not possible with state alone.

2. Focusing and Managing Input Elements: You can use refs to focus input elements, trigger animations, or perform other DOM-related actions. For example, you can programmatically focus an input field, which is not easily achievable with state alone.

3. Integrating with Third-Party Libraries: Refs are useful when integrating React with third-party libraries (like jQuery or D3) that rely on direct DOM manipulation. You can use refs to manage React components that wrap or interface with these libraries.

4. Measuring Elements: If you need to measure the size or position of a DOM element, you can use refs to access the underlying DOM node and gather measurements. This is especially useful for creating responsive components.

5. Interaction with Canvas or Media Elements: When working with `<canvas>` elements, video players, or audio players, you often need direct control. Refs are valuable for such cases, as you can interact with the underlying media elements or the canvas context directly.

6. Bypassing React's Reconciliation: Refs allow you to bypass React's virtual DOM reconciliation process in some cases. For instance, you can update the DOM element without causing React to re-render the entire component tree.

7. Optimizing Performance: In situations where you want to optimize performance, you can use refs to prevent unnecessary re-renders by controlling when and how components update. This can be crucial for performance-sensitive applications.

It's important to note that while refs provide these advantages, they should be used sparingly, and React's state management, props, and component lifecycle methods should still be your primary tools for managing your application's behavior. Refs are typically used for specific cases that require direct interaction with the DOM or other non-React parts of your application.


# 5
**Key Points:**

- React promotes declarative code, avoiding direct DOM manipulation.
- While using refs to directly manipulate DOM elements can be handy in specific cases, it should be used with caution.
- In the provided example, clearing an input field is demonstrated using a ref, bypassing React's declarative approach.
- Refs are useful for certain use cases, but overusing them for complex DOM interactions may go against React's principles.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function App() {
  const playerNameRef = useRef();

  const handleSetPlayerName = () => {
    const inputElement = playerNameRef.current;
    if (inputElement) {
      inputElement.value = ''; // Imperatively clear the input field
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={playerNameRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleSetPlayerName}>Set Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the example, a ref (`playerNameRef`) is used to directly clear the input field when the "Set Name" button is clicked. While this approach can be convenient for simple tasks like clearing an input, it involves imperative code and should be used judiciously within the declarative React paradigm.

## Understanding Refs and State

### Introduction to Key Concepts

- **Refs** are used to directly interact with DOM nodes or React elements. They persist across re-renders without causing additional renders themselves.
- **State** represents data that changes over time, with each update leading to a component re-render.

### Refs vs. State

- Refs provide a way to access and manipulate DOM elements directly for cases where the imperative approach is more suited.
- State facilitates the reactive data flow, automatically updating the UI upon data changes.

## Differences Between Refs and State

- **State Updates Trigger Re-renders**: When state is updated using its setter function, React re-renders the component to reflect the changes in the UI.
- **Refs Do Not Trigger Re-renders**: Changing a ref's value does not cause a re-render, making it suitable for values that don't impact the UI directly.

## Practical Applications

### Timer Challenge Component

This section illustrates how to integrate both refs and state into a practical application, demonstrating their distinct roles.

#### Scenario Description

- Implementing a timer challenge component that requires precise control over UI updates and direct DOM interactions.
- Utilizing state to manage timer status and UI messages.
- Considering refs for accessing DOM elements that don't necessitate re-renders.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Timer Component**: Define a component structure with a title, target time, and buttons to start/stop the challenge.
2. **Manage Timer State**: Use React state hooks to track the timer's running status and the challenge's completion state.
3. **Direct DOM Access with Refs**: (Hypothetical) Use refs to focus on an input element once the timer starts.

### Setting Timers and Managing State

- **Starting a Timer**: Illustrate the use of `setTimeout` within a React event handler to initiate a countdown.
- **State for Timer Expiry**: Implement state to reactively update the component upon timer completion, demonstrating the necessity of state over refs for UI updates.

```jsx
const TimerChallenge = ({ title, targetTime }) => {
  const [timerExpired, setTimerExpired] = useState(false);
  const [timerStarted, setTimerStarted] = useState(false);

  const handleStart = () => {
    setTimerStarted(true);
    setTimeout(() => setTimerExpired(true), targetTime * 1000);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <button onClick={handleStart}>{timerStarted ? "Stop" : "Start"} Challenge</button>
      {timerExpired && <p>You lost!</p>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## FAQs

**Q: When should I use refs instead of state?**  
A: Use refs for accessing DOM elements or storing values that do not directly impact the render output, such as keeping track of the previous state value.

**Q: Can refs and state be used together?**  
A: Absolutely, combining refs for direct DOM manipulations or value storage with state for reactive UI updates is a common and practical approach in React applications.

**Q: How do I prevent re-renders when using refs?**  
A: Since refs do not trigger re-renders by themselves, simply updating a ref's current value won't cause a component to re-render. This behavior is inherent and requires no additional prevention.

## Using Refs for Dynamic Timer Management

### Key Concepts

- Refs can hold any mutable value, not just DOM references, making them ideal for values like timer IDs that don’t directly impact the render output but need to persist across renders.
- State changes trigger component re-renders, while ref updates do not, highlighting their distinct roles in React components.

### Handling Timers with Refs and State

1. **Setting Timers**: Use `setTimeout` in conjunction with state to initiate timers.
2. **Stopping Timers**: Utilize `clearTimeout` and a ref to store the timer ID, allowing you to accurately stop timers without losing track due to re-renders.

#### Example Code Snippet

```jsx
const TimerChallenge = ({ targetTime }) => {
  const [timerStarted, setTimerStarted] = useState(false);
  const timerRef = useRef();

  const handleStart = () => {
    setTimerStarted(true);
    timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      // Timer expiration logic here
    }, targetTime * 1000);
  };

  const handleStop = () => {
    clearTimeout(timerRef.current);
    // Additional logic to handle timer stop
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={timerStarted ? handleStop : handleStart}>
        {timerStarted ? "Stop" : "Start"} Challenge
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

- This snippet demonstrates using both refs and state to manage a timer, highlighting the need for refs to persist timer IDs across renders without causing unnecessary re-renders.


### Complete example 1 :
Below is a simplified and well-commented example demonstrating how to use refs in a React component. This example expands on the provided `TimerChallenge` component, showing how to use `useRef` for managing a timer within a functional component. It includes a complete setup with state management for tracking whether the timer has started and utilizes a ref to hold the timer ID, allowing us to stop the timer as needed.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';

const TimerChallenge = ({ targetTime }) => {
  // State to track whether the timer has started
  const [timerStarted, setTimerStarted] = useState(false);

  // Ref to store the timer ID, allowing us to clear it later
  const timerRef = useRef(null);

  // Handler to start the timer
  const handleStart = () => {
    setTimerStarted(true); // Update state to indicate timer has started

    // Set a timer with setTimeout, storing its ID in the ref
    timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      alert("Time's up!"); // Alert or any other logic when timer expires
      setTimerStarted(false); // Reset timer state
    }, targetTime * 1000); // Convert targetTime from seconds to milliseconds
  };

  // Handler to stop the timer
  const handleStop = () => {
    clearTimeout(timerRef.current); // Clear the timer using the stored ID from the ref
    setTimerStarted(false); // Update state to indicate timer has stopped
    alert('Timer stopped successfully.'); // Alert or any other logic after stopping the timer
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Button text changes based on whether the timer has started */}
      <button onClick={timerStarted ? handleStop : handleStart}>
        {timerStarted ? 'Stop' : 'Start'} Challenge
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TimerChallenge;
```

### Key Points Explained:

- **useState**: Used to track the state (`timerStarted`) of the timer – whether it's running or not. This state dictates the button's label and functionality.
- **useRef**: Used to store a reference (`timerRef`) to the timer ID. Unlike state, updating a ref does not trigger a re-render. This makes it perfect for storing values that we need to persist across renders but don't directly influence the output.
- **setTimeout and clearTimeout**: JavaScript functions for managing timers. `setTimeout` initiates a timer that executes a function after a specified delay, returning a unique ID. `clearTimeout` uses this ID to stop the timer before it completes.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The button's onclick handler and text content change based on whether the timer has started, demonstrating a basic form of conditional rendering and interaction in React.

## Adding Challenges and Managing Timers

### Implementing Timer Challenges

- Introduce dynamic components to increase application interactivity, such as a timer challenge that users can start and stop.
- Utilize state to manage the status of each challenge and determine when to show results.

#### Key Steps

1. **Create a Timer Challenge Component**: Define a reusable component that accepts props like `title` and `targetTime` for customization.
2. **Manage Timer State**: Track whether each timer is running and if it has expired to update the UI accordingly.

## Implementing a Result Modal Component

### Displaying Results with a Modal

- Modals are utilized to provide immediate feedback to users, such as displaying the outcome of a timer challenge.

#### Development Process

1. **Define a Result Modal Component**: Use the built-in `<dialog>` element for simplicity, styling it to fit the application's design.
2. **Control Modal Visibility**: Instead of statically setting the `open` attribute, programmatically open the modal to leverage the browser's built-in backdrop for better UX.

#### Managing Modal with Refs

- Use refs to access the modal DOM element and control its visibility through JavaScript, ensuring that state changes in parent components don't interfere with the modal's behavior.

```jsx
const ResultModal = forwardRef(({ result, targetTime }, ref) => {
  return (
    <dialog ref={ref} className="ResultModal">
      <h2>You {result}!</h2>
      <p>The target time was <strong>{targetTime}</strong> seconds.</p>
      <form method="dialog">
        <button>Close</button>
      </form>
    </dialog>
  );
});
```

- This component demonstrates using refs to interact with DOM elements for functionalities beyond rendering, such as opening or closing a modal.


### The Complete Example: 
 Here's a simplified example of using the native HTML `<dialog>` element in React to create a modal dialog without `useEffect`. This example will demonstrate a basic modal that can be opened and closed with buttons, focusing on straightforward interaction without additional React hooks beyond `useRef` for direct DOM manipulation.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

// Simple Modal Component
const SimpleModal = ({ children }) => {
  // Create a ref for the dialog element
  const dialogRef = useRef(null);

  // Function to open the dialog
  const openDialog = () => {
    dialogRef.current.showModal(); // Use the showModal method to open the dialog
  };

  // Function to close the dialog
  const closeDialog = () => {
    dialogRef.current.close(); // Use the close method to close the dialog
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={openDialog}>Open Modal</button>
      <dialog ref={dialogRef} className="SimpleModal">
        {children}
        <form method="dialog">
          <button onClick={closeDialog}>Close</button>
        </form>
      </dialog>
    </div>
  );
};

// App Component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <SimpleModal>
        <p>This is a simple modal dialog!</p>
      </SimpleModal>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Key Points Explained:

- **`useRef` and `<dialog>`**: The `useRef` hook creates a reference (`dialogRef`) to the `<dialog>` HTML element, allowing direct manipulation of this element in our component. This is crucial for calling methods like `showModal` and `close` on the dialog element.
  
- **Opening and Closing the Dialog**: The `openDialog` function calls `showModal` on the referenced dialog element to display it, while the `closeDialog` function calls `close` to hide it. These functions are triggered by button clicks.
  
- **Form and Close Button**: Inside the dialog, a form with a close button is used to handle the closing action. The form's `method="dialog"` attribute is a standard way to include submission buttons that close the dialog, though in this case, we're manually handling the close action with a click event listener for demonstration purposes.

This example provides a straightforward demonstration of how to use the native HTML `<dialog>` element in a React application to create a modal dialog, utilizing refs for direct DOM access without the complexity of additional React hooks like `useEffect`.



## FAQs

**Q: Can refs be used for anything other than accessing DOM elements?**  
A: Yes, refs can hold any mutable value, making them versatile for various use cases beyond DOM element access, such as storing timer IDs.

**Q: How do I prevent a timer from losing its ID due to component re-renders?**  
A: Store the timer ID in a ref within the component. This ensures the ID persists across re-renders without causing additional re-renders itself.

# React Advanced Techniques: Refs, Forwarding, and Component APIs

This documentation consolidates the teachings from a series of video tutorials focusing on more advanced React concepts: forwarding refs to custom components, managing dialog visibility, and exposing component APIs via hooks. The aim is to provide a thorough guide with explanations, examples, and best practices to deepen your understanding of React.

## Forwarding Refs to Custom Components

### Introduction

- **Refs** provide direct access to a DOM element within React components, crucial for managing focus, selection, or animations.
- **Forwarding refs** is a technique that passes a ref through a component to one of its child components, allowing the child to be directly referenced outside of its scope.

### Key Concepts

- **Creating and Forwarding Refs**: Utilize `React.forwardRef` to forward refs from parent to child components.
- **Accessing DOM Elements**: Access native DOM API methods, such as `showModal` on a dialog element, through forwarded refs.

### Example: Forwarding a Dialog Ref

```jsx
import React, { useRef, forwardRef } from 'react';

// ResultModal component using forwardRef to receive a ref from its parent
const ResultModal = forwardRef(({ targetTime, result }, ref) => (
  <dialog ref={ref}>
    <h2>You {result}!</h2>
    <p>The target time was <strong>{targetTime}</strong> seconds.</p>
    {/* Close button logic */}
  </dialog>
));

const TimerChallenge = () => {
  const dialogRef = useRef(null);

  const showResult = () => {
    dialogRef.current.showModal(); // Directly calls showModal on the dialog element
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={showResult}>Show Result</button>
      <ResultModal ref={dialogRef} targetTime={5} result="won" />
    </>
  );
};
```

- This code snippet demonstrates forwarding a ref from the `TimerChallenge` component to the `ResultModal` component, enabling direct manipulation of the dialog element.

## Exposing Component APIs via the useImperativeHandle Hook

### Overview

- **Encapsulation and Component APIs**: Sometimes, it's beneficial to expose certain methods from a child component to a parent component while keeping other details private.
- **useImperativeHandle** hook allows child components to expose specific instance values (like functions) to the parent component via ref forwarding.

### Key Concepts

- **Enhancing Component Flexibility**: By encapsulating logic within the component and exposing only necessary APIs, components become more reusable and maintainable.
- **Collaboration-Friendly Components**: This pattern aids in team projects where encapsulation ensures components can be safely modified without impacting their consumers.

### Example: Using `useImperativeHandle` to Expose a Modal Open Method

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';

const ResultModal = forwardRef(({ result }, ref) => {
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    openModal: () => {
      document.querySelector("#resultModal").showModal();
    }
  }));

  return (
    <dialog id="resultModal">
      <h2>{result}</h2>
      {/* Dialog Content */}
    </dialog>
  );
});

const TimerChallenge = () => {
  const modalRef = useRef(null);

  const handleShowModal = () => {
    modalRef.current.openModal(); // Calls openModal method exposed by the ResultModal
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleShowModal}>Show Modal</button>
      <ResultModal ref={modalRef} result="won" />
    </>
  );
};
```

- In this example, `ResultModal` exposes an `openModal` method using `useImperativeHandle`, allowing the parent component (`TimerChallenge`) to open the modal without directly invoking DOM methods.

## FAQs

**Q: Why should I use `forwardRef` instead of prop drilling for refs?**  
A: `forwardRef` creates a more direct and maintainable way to access DOM elements or child component instances directly, avoiding the complexity and verbosity of prop drilling through multiple component layers.

**Q: Is `useImperativeHandle` commonly used?**  
A: While not as common as other hooks due to its niche use case for controlling child components' instances from a parent, `useImperativeHandle` is powerful for creating flexible and encapsulated component APIs.

# Some Simple Examples for Ref
## 1
let's create a simple, stand-alone example demonstrating the use of refs in React. This example will focus on creating a functional component that automatically focuses on an input field when the component mounts. It's a common use case that showcases the utility of refs for direct DOM manipulation.

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function AutoFocusInput() {
  // Create a ref to store the input element
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  // useEffect hook to perform actions after the component mounts
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the input element exists and then focus on it
    if(inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once after initial render

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Autofocus Input Example</h2>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder="Focus on me automatically" />
      {/* The ref attribute links the input element to the inputRef */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default AutoFocusInput;
```

### Key Points Explained:

- **useRef Hook**: This hook creates a `ref` object (`inputRef`) that can hold a reference to a DOM element. The object has a `.current` property that is initialized to the argument passed to `useRef` (initially `null`).

- **useEffect Hook**: This React hook is used to perform side effects in function components. In this example, it's used to set focus on the input element after the component mounts. The empty dependency array (`[]`) ensures that the effect runs only once after the initial render, mimicking the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method in class components.

- **ref Attribute**: The `ref` attribute on the `<input>` element tells React to store a reference to that DOM element in `inputRef.current` when the component mounts. This allows direct access to the input element and its properties, such as `.focus()`.

This simple example demonstrates how refs can be used to directly interact with DOM elements in functional components, providing a way to perform imperative actions like focusing an input field.


## 2
Let's explore another example utilizing refs in React, this time focusing on capturing user input without utilizing the `useEffect` hook. We'll create a functional component with a button that, when clicked, alerts the current value of an input field using a ref. This approach directly accesses the input element's value without managing it through React's state.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function AlertInputValue() {
  // Creating a ref object to hold the input element
  const inputRef = useRef();

  // Function to alert the current value of the input field
  const showAlertWithInputValue = () => {
    // Using the ref's current property to access the input element
    // and alerting its value
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Alert Input Value Example</h2>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder="Type something..." />
      {/* The ref attribute links this input element to the inputRef object */}
      <button onClick={showAlertWithInputValue}>Alert Input Value</button>
      {/* On button click, showAlertWithInputValue is called */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default AlertInputValue;
```

### Key Points Explained:

- **useRef Hook**: Creates a `ref` object (`inputRef`) intended to "hold onto" a DOM element, allowing direct access to that element. Initially, the `.current` property of the ref object is set to `null`.

- **ref Attribute**: The `ref` attribute is assigned the `inputRef` object, linking the `<input>` DOM element to `inputRef.current`. This linkage is established when the component mounts, providing direct access to the input element.

- **Direct DOM Manipulation**: When the button is clicked, the `showAlertWithInputValue` function executes. It directly accesses the `<input>` element's current value through `inputRef.current.value` and displays it using an alert. This demonstrates an imperative approach to accessing a DOM element's properties, contrasting with React's declarative data handling via state.

This example showcases the practical use of refs for direct DOM access in functional components, eliminating the need for `useEffect` when you don't need to react to changes or perform side effects upon component mounting or updating. It's a straightforward technique for accessing elements imperatively in event handlers.



For a simple and comprehensive example involving React and `setInterval` for timer management, let's create a basic countdown timer. This timer will start from a specified number of seconds and count down to zero. Upon reaching zero, the timer stops and displays a message.

## Example (Full)
### Countdown Timer Component

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function CountdownTimer({ startSeconds }) {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(startSeconds);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Only set the interval if seconds > 0
    if (seconds > 0) {
      const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        setSeconds(seconds - 1);
      }, 1000);

      // Clear interval on component unmount
      return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
    }
  }, [seconds]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Countdown: {seconds}</h1>
      {seconds === 0 && <h2>Time's up!</h2>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default CountdownTimer;
```

### Key Points:

1. **useState Hook**: Initializes the countdown timer's starting seconds.
2. **useEffect Hook**: Manages the side effect of setting up and clearing the interval.
3. **setInterval**: Used to decrease the countdown timer by one second at each interval.
4. **clearInterval**: Ensures the interval is cleared to prevent memory leaks or errors when the component unmounts or the countdown reaches zero.
5. **Conditionally Rendering**: Displays "Time's up!" when the countdown reaches zero.

This example provides a straightforward implementation of a countdown timer in React, demonstrating the use of hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) and `setInterval` for basic state management and side effects handling.
