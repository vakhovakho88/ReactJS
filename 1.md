# Introduction to React

- Component Driven User Interfaces
- Buidling Interacrtive and Scalable UIs

### Content

- treact Core Syntax & JSX
- Working with Components
- Working with Data

### Components

- React simplifies building user interfaces
- React is all about "Components"
- Everything on the Website are components
- Components are reusable custom blocks
- In React we build custom Components and then compose them into a final user interface
- Reusability (Dont Repeat yourself) and Separation of concerns (Small separate units, easy to manage) are Pros of React
- Every Component consisting of HTML, JS and CSS
- Long Story Short: We are Bulding own, Custom HTML,JS,CSS Elements.

### Configuration

- NodeJS download: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Create-react-app is a git repository, it creates blan react app

```javascript

npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app

npm start

```

- Wenn we run create-react-app it needs several minutes to complete
- Then we go to the project directory and run: npm start
- Development server will be started

- Package.json Development dependencies
- src folder holds an actual source code
- never edit node_modules
- If we import a Project from another sources we need to run npm install to install all dependencies they are in package.json

#### analyzing react project structure

- index.js will be executed automatically at first

In index.js

```javascript
//Importing modules
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
// Render to "App" component to root.
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

- As we see it, in this file react renders a main Component to root.
- App is just a component it is a root of our nested components.

- id: "root" is in the file: public/index.html and it is a main page that will be loaded
- It means react renders our root component in index.html to the div of id = root

#### JSX

- If wee lokk at App.js the function returns:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- This is JSX syntax (Javascript XML)
- It is developer friendly to combine javascript and HTML together
- Of course react translates it automatically to web-browser friendly javascript code
- We can just import that component as normal tag. <App />
- With this approach we achieve declarative way to programming
- With vanillaJS we are doint it imperative way. We are giving instructions to find the places and render something there.

- It is recomended to put every component in a separate file. And to have components in a directory.
- We create a components directory in code/src directory
- We dont put App.js component in this directory, because it is a main component

#### Our fisrt component

- We are free to name it, but there is a convention, that a component and every subword of it startes with capital letter.
- A component i react is just a javascript function, they return html code
- Step 1: Create a directory "components"
- Step 2: Create a file "ExpenseItem.js" with code:

```javascript
function ExpenseItem() {
  return <h2>Expense item!</h2>;
}

export default ExpenseItem;
```

- Then we can import it anywhere (In this case to App.js)

```javascript
import ExpenseItem from "./components/ExpenseItem";
```

- And call the component just like this (here 3 times):

```javascript
<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>
<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>
<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>
```

- As we see it all our custom components should be started with uppercase.
- Create component-> Export-> Import -> Use
- Very important rool to know ist, that return of function must have only one root element!
- To achive this we can simply put the code in opening and closing div.
- Shift+alt+f format html tags and code

#### Formatting a component

- In the directory of Component we put a separate css file with the same name (Just a convention) as component file
- In our case "ExpenseItem.css"
- Then we write our styling in this file and import it to the component, where it belongs (ExpenseItem.js)

```javascript
import "./ExpenseItem.css";
```

- When we want to assign a class to HTML Tag we dont write class there, we write className="Bla"
- Example:

```javascript
<div className="expense-item">
```

- Create component-> create styling-> add styling to component-> export component-> import component

#### Outputing Dynamic Data

- We need that our components are reusable.
- It means we need dynamic data as output and not hardcoded values
- To achieve it we need to use regular javascript logic.

- Let us say we want that ammount in dollars and Date will be given as parameters to JSX

```javascript
function ExpenseItem() {
  const expenseDate = new Date(2021, 7, 8);
  const expenseAmount = 300;

  return (
    <div className="expense-item">
      <div>{expenseDate.toISOString()}</div>
      <div className="expense-item__price">${expenseAmount}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- If we want call any javascript code or javascript objects in our JSX we should put it between {}

#### Props (Properties)

- In the example above, the values are hardcodes as javascript variables.
- But we want to give values to component as Arguments
- To realise this approach we use Props
- Props are like Parameters for the function
- Let us create a different expenses as an array of javascript objects
- for every element of the array we render the ExpenseItem component

- In App.js main function we put:

```javascript
const expenses = [
  {
    id: "e1",
    title: "Toilet Paper",
    amount: 94.12,
    date: new Date(2020, 7, 14),
  },
  { id: "e2", title: "New TV", amount: 799.49, date: new Date(2021, 2, 12) },
  {
    id: "e3",
    title: "Car Insurance",
    amount: 294.67,
    date: new Date(2021, 2, 28),
  },
  {
    id: "e4",
    title: "New Desk (Wooden)",
    amount: 450,
    date: new Date(2021, 5, 12),
  },
];
```

- Giving the values as props to a component

```javascript
<ExpenseItem
  title={expenses[0].title}
  amount={expenses[0].amount}
  date={expenses[0].date}
></ExpenseItem>
```

- Extract and use values in the component
- We have one parameter of the function and this is a collection of keyvalue pairs
- Key ist equal to the object name what we used as argument, in our case we have 3 keys: title, amount and date
- We can call it what we want: props, data etc.

```javascript
function ExpenseItem(props) {

  const expenseDate = props.date;
  const expenseTitle = props.title;
  const expenseAmount = props.amount;
...

}
```

- We can pass hardcoded values to components if we wanted to di it.

- Let us extract date well formated and with javascript standard functions

- If the code is long it is better to extract props in variables and then call it in jsx
- Extract date values

```javascript
const month = props.date.toLocaleString("en-us", { month: "long" });
const day = props.date.toLocaleString("en-us", { day: "2-digit" });
const year = props.date.getFullYear();
```

- Call them from JSX

```javascript
<div>
  <div>{month}</div>
  <div>{year}</div>
  <div>{day}</div>
</div>
```

- If there is not content between opening and closing tag we can use one tag.

```javascript
<MyComponent></MyComponent>
//is similar to:
<MyComponent />

```

- Let us split our code
- Create new component for date "ExpenseDate.js", "ExpenseDate.css"
- Now we have following split:

App.js

```javascript
      ...
      <ExpenseItem
        title={expenses[0].title}
        amount={expenses[0].amount}
        date={expenses[0].date}
      />
    ...

```

ExpenceItem.js

```javascript
<div className="expense-item">
  <ExpenceDate date={props.date} />
  ...another components/divs
</div>
```

ExpenceDate.js

```javascript
function ExpenseDate(props) {
  const month = props.date.toLocaleString("en-us", { month: "long" });
  const day = props.date.toLocaleString("en-us", { day: "2-digit" });
  const year = props.date.getFullYear();
  return (
    <div className="expense-date">
      <div className="expense-date__month">{month}</div>
      <div className="expense-date__year">{year}</div>
      <div className="expense-date__day">{day}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExpenseDate;
```

- App.js -> ExpenseItem.js -> ExpenseDate.js
- We are giving props from app js, an date part will be given from expenseitem to expense date
- As we see it, we can give props hierarchical
- Keep components as clean and as small possible!

- The next split: Instead of calling several ExpenseItems in App.js let us create a new component (Expenses.js) for the List:

App.js

```javascript
import Expenses from "./components/Expenses";

function App() {
  const expenses = [ Data here];

  return (
    <div>
     <Expenses items={expenses} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

Expenses.js

```javascript
import ExpenseItem from "./ExpenseItem";
import "./Expenses.css";

function Expenses(props) {
  const expenses = props.items;
  return (
    <div className="expenses">
      <ExpenseItem
        title={expenses[0].title}
        amount={expenses[0].amount}
        date={expenses[0].date}
      />
      //another expenseItems
    </div>
  );
}

export default Expenses;
```

- Structuring css, js, htm together in one component called composition
- Custom component cannot be a root component !

- If we want to use custom component as wrapper component (as root) (and we should use it)
- Let us create a wrapper component Card, that contains every information about item
- It means, instead of wrapper div for every item we will use Card

Card.js

```javascript
// This is a wrapper container for item

function Card(props) {
  //generate a classname dinamically
  const className = "card " + props.className;
  return <div className={className}>{props.children}</div>;
}
export default Card;
```

- We are giving classname from parent element, and as it is a wrapper element it is necessary that we have "props.children" between tags, it doesnot need any argument, everything what we will give between tags belong to "props.children".

ExpenseItem.js

```javascript
//import card
//...
return (
  <Card className="expense-item">
    <ExpenceDate date={props.date} />

    <div className="expense-item__description">
      <h2>{expenseTitle}</h2>
      <div className="expense-item__price">${expenseAmount}</div>
    </div>
  </Card>
);
//...
```

- As we see it a root element of this item is Card now.
- This reusable Card contaner could be used for another items too.
- We use its for Expenses too.

Expenses.js

```javascript
<Card className="expenses">
  <ExpenseItem
    title={expenses[0].title}
    amount={expenses[0].amount}
    date={expenses[0].date}
  />

 ..
</Card>
```
* It is just a way to have an empty reusable container and we can put different content inside.
* It is just a separate reusable wrapper component

#### A little Summary
* React Core Syntax & JSX
* Working with Components
* Working with Data


#### A Closer look at JSX
* JSX is not in the browser, it is just a syntactic sugar
* Without JSX we should use React.createElement in nested way, and it is very uncomfortable.
* In older versions of react we needed to import react in every file to use React.createElement 

#### Organising components
* It is better if we orginise components and put them in folders grouped by same features
* It is up to us how we split them
* In our project case we have Card component, that is general UI component and has not a specific feature of the app. 
* And we have another components, they  have specific meaning to render exopenses and expence data
* Thats why we create UI and Expenses folders
* UI contains general components 
* Expenses contains components with specific meanings
* Then we need to Adjust all import links

![Components splitted in folders](dokus\5_components_divided.png)

* For the functions let us use arrow function to have moder javascript version
* Let us use it for every function

```javascript
//this is an example
const App = () => {}

```
