Certainly! Let's tailor the exercise to focus on implementing a search feature for a list of cities, with each city object containing information about the city name, population, and area.

### Exercise: City Information Search with React Hooks

**Objective:** Develop a React component that enables users to search for cities from a provided list. Each city object in the list should include the city name, population, and area. The exercise will focus on using React hooks for state management, handling user input, and conditionally rendering search results.

**Key Concepts:**

- State management with `useState`
- User input handling
- Conditional rendering

**Requirements:**

1. **Data Setup:**
   - Create an array of objects, each representing a city. Each object should include the following properties: `city` (name of the city), `population` (number of inhabitants), and `area` (size in square kilometers).
   - Example of a city object: `{ city: "Example City", population: 1000000, area: 500 }`

2. **Search Input:**
   - Implement a text input field to allow users to search for cities by name.
   - Use the `useState` hook to manage the input value from the search field.

3. **Filter Logic:**
   - Write logic to filter the list of cities based on the user's search input. The search should be case-insensitive and allow partial matches for the city name.
   - You can choose to use the `useEffect` hook to respond to changes in the search input and filter the list accordingly, or directly filter the list within the component's render logic.

4. **Displaying Results:**
   - Display the filtered list of cities, showing the city name, population, and area for each matching city.
   - Implement conditional rendering to show a message (e.g., "No cities found.") when there are no matches to the search query.

**Development Tips:**

- Start with defining your city data array within the component or as a separate module.
- Ensure the search input is properly connected to your component's state, allowing for dynamic searching.
- Focus on creating an efficient filter function that can handle partial matches and ignore case sensitivity.
- Pay attention to how you display the results, ensuring the user can easily read the city information.

This exercise is designed to strengthen your understanding of React's core features, including state management, handling user input, and conditional rendering, all within the context of a practical example. Upon completing the exercise, sharing your code will provide an opportunity for feedback and further learning.
