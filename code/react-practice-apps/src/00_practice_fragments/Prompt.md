I'm looking to enhance my React skills with short, targeted exercises that emphasize specific React features or best practices. Could you provide a single, compact exercise that focuses on a key React concept? I'm interested in areas such as state management, hooks, conditional rendering, or form handling. The exercise should be manageable within a brief coding session and offer a deep dive into the chosen topic. After completing the exercise, I plan to share my code for feedback. My goal is to solidify my understanding of React through these concentrated challenges.
