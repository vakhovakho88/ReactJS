This is a plan for a Stopwatch app.

Here's what we're going to include:
 - Page Title: "Stopwatch"
 - Main Section
     - H1 Heading
     - Timer Display
     - Three buttons under the timer: "Start", "Round", "Reset", and "Pause"
     - A table with columns for: "Round Number", "Start Time", "End Time", "Round Duration". Each row will have a "Delete" button at the end.
     - A "Clear" button under the table that clears all entries from the table.
  

We are going to build this application in React. Let's break down the entire application into the following components:

- `App.js`: This is the main component that will house the Stopwatch component and any other components you might add in the future.
    - `Stopwatch.js`: This component will contain the Timer, TimerButtons, and RoundTable components.
        - `Timer.js`: This component will display the current time of the stopwatch.
        - `TimerButtons.js`: This component will contain all the control buttons for the stopwatch, such as Start, Pause, and Reset.
            - `CustomButton.js`: This is a reusable button component that will be used in `TimerButtons.js`.
        - `RoundTable.js`: This component will display a table of rounds.
            - `TableMainRow.js`: This component will represent the main row of the table, possibly containing headers.
            - `TableRow.js`: This is a reusable component for each row in the table, displaying data for each round.
  

Design Plan:

- `Stopwatch.js`: This is the main container for the application. It has a background color, a border, and padding. It is centered on the page, and all child components are also centered. The border will have a slight border-radius (5px) for a softer look.

- `Timer.js`: This component has no background color but has minimalistic borders and a beautiful color. It has a hover event that creates a subtle highlight. The text will have a slight text-shadow (1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) to give it depth.

- `TimerButtons.js`: This component has no border and no background color.

- `CustomButton.js`: The buttons are minimalistic with borders and have a transparent background color. They have hover and click states for interactivity. The buttons will also have a slight border-radius (3px) for a softer look.

- `RoundTable.js`: The table row has no background color, minimalistic borders, and the color of the text. The text will have a slight text-shadow (1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) to give it depth.
